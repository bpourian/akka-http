### Akka Streams





#### Note

When to use which subtype?

Use HttpEntityStrict if the amount of data is "small" and already available in memory (e.g. as a String or ByteString)

Use HttpEntityDefault if the data is generated by a streaming data source and the size of the data is known

Use HttpEntityChunked for an entity of unknown length

Use HttpEntityCloseDelimited for a response as a legacy alternative to HttpEntityChunked if the client doesn't support 
chunked transfer encoding. Otherwise use HttpEntityChunked!

In a Multipart.Bodypart use HttpEntityIndefiniteLength for content of unknown length.
